# SQL-Mini-Project
This is an SQL mini project I completed during my training with Sparta Global.

The goal of the project was to test my knowledge of SQL queries by having me write queries to answer a variety of question.

The aspects of SQL used:
* CREATE TABLE
* SQL Data Types
* INSERT INTO
* SELECT
* WHERE clause
* LIKE and wildcards
* Concatenation
* Formatting dates and numbers
* Column aliases
* Simple and complex JOIN statements
* Subqueries
